## Create your next Gatsby Plugin

### Get started

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter/generate) to create a new repository based on the code in this repository, but with a clean history. There is no need to drag all the commits of this repository by forking.
2. Select the correct owner and give it a name according to the [Gatsby Plugin naming standard](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/naming-a-plugin).
3. Clone your new repository onto your machine for development and run `yarn install`

### Make it yours

1. Make the readme template the root template (`mv README_TEMPLATE.md README.md`)
2. Delete the changelog (`rm CHANGELOG.md`)
3. Search and replace `@raae/gatsby-plugin-starter` with the name of your plugin
4. Search and replace `github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-starter` with the link to your repository
5. Search and replace `queen@raae.codes` with your email address
6. Search and replace `@raae` with your GitHub username
7. Change the description in `plugin/package.json`
8. Change the tag line in `README.md`
9. Commit changes `git commit -a -m "chore: rename all the things"`
10. Create an initial tag (`git tag v0.0.0 -a -m "Initial tag"`) and push it (`git push origin --tags`)

### Develop and test

Check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

### Release

The project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to automate releases by utalizing the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) project and GitHub Actions.

As the project owner, you need to add an NPM token to your repository secrets so that Semantic Release can do its thing ðŸ’ª

- Create an automation access token on [npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Avatar -> Access Token).
- Add `NPM_TOKEN` to your repository secrets (Settings -> Secret -> Action) with the value from above.

#### Semantic Release Settings

Commits to the main branch will result in a new release while committing to a next branch will result in a pre-release. The releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and [your commit messages](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer) will decide the following version number.

- Commits message titles prefixed by `fix:`, `fix(<scope>):` and `docs(README):` will result in a patch version update
- Commits message titles prefixed by `feat:`, `feat(<scope>):` will result in a minor version update
- Commits message footers containing `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `BREAKING CHANGES:` will result in a major version update

In addition to automating releases, Semantic Release creates and updates a `CHANGELOG.md` based on the above commit rules.

Check the `.releaserc` file, the `.github/workflows/release.yml` and the [Semantic Release documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for more details.
